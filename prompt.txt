I want to convert the whole project code to PHP MySQLi Procedural.


Convert each to MySQLi Procedural

edit-vehicle.php   : 
______________________________________________

Act like a world-class frontend developer. Improve the entire page's aesthetics with better design choices, modern UI elements, and enhanced layouts. Use frameworks like using Bootstrap v3.3.7  or Font Awesome 4.7.0 and css only to make the page visually appealing. Optimize user experience in every possible way, ensuring responsiveness, smooth interactions, and intuitive navigation. Elevate the overall look and feel to a professional standard.

Note: Do not to use bootstrap classes in your custom css code cos I dont want it to affect other sections, just use another class that isn't boostrap related for css
Give me section <section> code in html only. Dont give me the head content, just give me the css code seperately. 

primary code #a0111f
secondary color #6d071a
every other key color should be simlar to that, now update


use the logo in the  <div class="about-section">, two col-sm-6 , logo on one side, text on the other side. it should be beautiful pls. update the code

______________________________________________

I want to use passowrd hash and password verify function instead of md5
Using md5() for password hashing is insecure. Switch to password_hash() and password_verify() for better security.

Allow automatic login when signup, instead of having to login again after signup

1. Layout & Structure.
Background Image:
use a full-width, high-quality background image with an overlay for better readability.

Form Layout:

Use a grid-based layout on desktop (4-column or 2-row structure).

Use a stacked layout on mobile (single-column).

Ensure form elements are well-spaced and aligned for readability.

2. Form Fields

1. Pick-up Date (Date Picker)

Uses <input type="date"> with a calendar icon.

Styled with a rounded border and subtle shadow.

2. Return Date (Optional Date Picker)

Can be disabled by default until activated.

3. Pick-up Location (Input) 




3. CTA Button ("Make Reservation")

Desktop:

Centered below the form.

Uses a bold primary colour background with white text.

Hover effect: Slightly darker with a smooth transition.

This code ensures full responsiveness by using CSS, Bootstrap Grid and Media Queries.


I want to convert the whole project code. Dont do anything yet. I will tell you what to do later.

this is the file structure and I will give you the code one after the other.


on this page, ensure the 
From Date:
comes before 
To Date:

if not , send an alert to explain what to do and also ensure

Car already booked for these days alert should refresh on same page, not car-listing.php

        echo "<script>alert('Car already booked for these days');</script>";
        echo "<script type='text/javascript'> document.location = ; </script>";

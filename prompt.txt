Act like a world-class frontend developer. Improve the entire page's aesthetics with better design choices, modern UI elements, and enhanced layouts. Use frameworks like using Bootstrap v3.3.7  or Font Awesome 4.7.0 and css only to make the page visually appealing. Optimize user experience in every possible way, ensuring responsiveness, smooth interactions, and intuitive navigation. Elevate the overall look and feel to a professional standard.

Note: Do not to use bootstrap classes in your custom css code cos I dont want it to affect other sections, just use another class that isn't boostrap related for css
Give me section <section> code in html only. Dont give me the head content, just give me the css code seperately. 

primary code #a0111f
secondary color #6d071a
